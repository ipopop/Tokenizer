Detail of tests and logs :

1. Find a webpage, a text, or any other NLP dataset.

2. Tokenize the text using NLTK 'WordPunctTokenizer'.

3. Explore the list of 'tokens' and their frequency.

4. Experiment with the 'WordCloud()' parameters to generate different word clouds from the original text:

    - collocations = False

    - normalize_plurals = True or False

    - include_numbers = True or False

    - min_word_length

    - stopwords

5. Remove 'stopwords' from the original text.

6. Use 'string.punctuation' and 'string.digits' to remove punctuation and numbers.

Tests and logs for each of the steps in text processing and word cloud generation process.

1. Find a webpage, a text, or any other NLP dataset.

      - Test: Check if the data source is accessible and the data is successfully retrieved.

      - Log: Log the source of the data and the size of the data retrieved.

2. Tokenize the text using NLTK 'WordPunctTokenizer'.

    - Test: Check if the text is correctly tokenized into individual words.
  
    - Log: Log the number of tokens generated.

3. Explore the list of 'tokens' and their frequency.

    - Test: Check if the frequency of each token is correctly calculated.

    - Log: Log the most and least frequent tokens.

4. Experiment with the 'WordCloud()' parameters to generate different word clouds from the original text.

    - Test: Check if the word cloud is correctly generated with the given parameters.

    - Log: Log the parameters used for generating the word cloud.

5. Remove 'stopwords' from the original text.

    - Test: Check if all stopwords are correctly removed from the text.

    - Log: Log the number of stopwords removed.

6. Use 'string.punctuation' and 'string.digits' to remove punctuation and numbers.

    - Test: Check if all punctuation and numbers are correctly removed from the text.

    - Log: Log the number of punctuation marks and numbers removed.


For each of these steps, there is a corresponding function in code, and a test function in test file that checks if the function is working correctly. The logging be done within each function using the logger set up with setup_logger.

 log files are typically stored in a dedicated directory at the root level of the project. This makes it easy to find and manage the log files.

The directory is often named logs or something similar. Here's an example of what the project structure might look like:

/the_project
    /src
        /utils
            logger_setup.py
    /tests
        /utils
            test_logger.py
    /logs
        project_logs.log
    README.md
    @todo.md

In this structure, project_logs.log is a log file stored in the logs directory. When you set up your logger, you would specify the path to the log file as 'logs/project_logs.log'.

This is just a common convention and the actual location can vary depending on the specific requirements of your project. For example, in some projects, log files might be stored in a separate storage system or sent to a logging service, especially in distributed systems.
