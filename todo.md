Detail of tests and logs :

1. Find a webpage, a text, or any other NLP dataset.

2. Tokenize the text using NLTK 'WordPunctTokenizer'.

3. Explore the list of 'tokens' and their frequency.

4. Experiment with the 'WordCloud()' parameters to generate different word clouds from the original text:

    - collocations = False

    - normalize_plurals = True or False

    - include_numbers = True or False

    - min_word_length

    - stopwords

5. Remove 'stopwords' from the original text.

6. Use 'string.punctuation' and 'string.digits' to remove punctuation and numbers.

Tests and logs for each of the steps in text processing and word cloud generation process.

1. Find a webpage, a text, or any other NLP dataset.

      - Test: Check if the data source is accessible and the data is successfully retrieved.

      - Log: Log the source of the data and the size of the data retrieved.

2. Tokenize the text using NLTK 'WordPunctTokenizer'.

    - Test: Check if the text is correctly tokenized into individual words.
  
    - Log: Log the number of tokens generated.

3. Explore the list of 'tokens' and their frequency.

    - Test: Check if the frequency of each token is correctly calculated.

    - Log: Log the most and least frequent tokens.

4. Experiment with the 'WordCloud()' parameters to generate different word clouds from the original text.

    - Test: Check if the word cloud is correctly generated with the given parameters.

    - Log: Log the parameters used for generating the word cloud.

5. Remove 'stopwords' from the original text.

    - Test: Check if all stopwords are correctly removed from the text.

    - Log: Log the number of stopwords removed.

6. Use 'string.punctuation' and 'string.digits' to remove punctuation and numbers.

    - Test: Check if all punctuation and numbers are correctly removed from the text.

    - Log: Log the number of punctuation marks and numbers removed.


For each of these steps, there is a corresponding function in code, and a test function in test file that checks if the function is working correctly. The logging be done within each function using the logger set up with setup_logger.

 log files are typically stored in a dedicated directory at the root level of the project. This makes it easy to find and manage the log files.

The directory is often named logs or something similar. Here's an example of what the project structure might look like:

/the_project
    /src
        /utils
            logger_setup.py
    /tests
        /utils
            test_logger.py
    /logs
        project_logs.log
    README.md
    @todo.md

In this structure, project_logs.log is a log file stored in the logs directory. When you set up your logger, you would specify the path to the log file as 'logs/project_logs.log'.

This is just a common convention and the actual location can vary depending on the specific requirements of your project. For example, in some projects, log files might be stored in a separate storage system or sent to a logging service, especially in distributed systems.

Actually, the errors you're seeing, when running the log test, are because the methods remove_punctuation_and_numbers, remove_stopwords, token_frequency, and generate_word_cloud are not yet implemented in the Tokenizer class. They are currently just placeholders returning default values.

Implement the methods one by one following the TDD steps.

Write a failing test: You already have failing tests for the methods remove_punctuation_and_numbers, remove_stopwords, token_frequency, and generate_word_cloud.

Write code to pass the test: Let's start with the remove_punctuation_and_numbers method. Here's a simple implementation using Python's built-in translate and maketrans functions

File by file, and step by step, give me the entire content code (TDD / Clean Archi / Clean Code / Real World Code)

now implement the first method in the todo list who are currently just placeholders returning default values

the goal is to pass (TDD refactor step) the "test_logger.py" test

Important! : the actual files containing the methods (with just placeholders) are not empty, so read the entire existing code before add a clean refactor

Important! : the "log management" is not yet implemented in all the files, functions and methods, so implement them as soon as possible

Important! : i don't need examples or "simple implementation" the code must be the best code possible for the exact context.

The context : @main.py @requirements.txt @src/fetch_text/fetch_text.py @src/punctuation_and_number_remover/punctuation_and_number_remover.py @src/stopwords_remover/stopwords_remover.py @src/tokenizer/tokenizer.py @src/wordcloud_generator/wordcloud_generator.py @src/utils/logger_setup.py @tests/test_fetch_text.py @tests/test_punctuation_and_number_remover.py @tests/test_stopwords_remover.py @tests/test_tokenizer.py @tests/test_wordcloud_generator.py @tests/utils/test_logger.py

Based on the provided context, here are the current implementations of the relevant classes and methods:

fetch_text.py: This file contains functions to fetch HTML from a URL, parse the HTML to extract text, and clean the text by removing scripts, styles, and blank lines.

tokenizer.py: This file contains the Tokenizer class with a tokenize method that tokenizes the input text using NLTK's WordPunctTokenizer and logs the number of tokens generated.

wordcloud_generator.py: This file contains the WordcloudGenerator class with a generate_wordcloud method that generates a word cloud from the input text.

punctuation_and_number_remover.py: This file contains the PunctuationAndNumberRemover class with a remove_punctuation_and_numbers method that removes all punctuation and numbers from the input text.

stopwords_remover.py: This file contains the StopwordsRemover class with a remove_stopwords method that removes all stopwords from the input text.

logger_setup.py: This file contains a logger_setup function that sets up a logger with a specified log file and level.

The methods token_frequency and generate_word_cloud are not provided in the context, so I assume they are not yet implemented in the Tokenizer class.

 In a clean architecture, each class should have a single responsibility and there should be a clear separation of concerns.

The Tokenizer class is responsible for tokenizing the text, and the PunctuationAndNumberRemover class is responsible for removing punctuation and numbers from the text.

To maintain this separation of concerns, you should not create an instance of PunctuationAndNumberRemover inside the Tokenizer class. Instead, you should ensure that the text passed to the Tokenizer class has already had punctuation and numbers removed.

This could be achieved in the main.py file (or wherever you orchestrate the sequence of operations) by first using the PunctuationAndNumberRemover to clean the text, and then passing the cleaned text to the Tokenizer.
