The next step would be to write tests for the remaining classes in your project.

Based on the structure of your project, it seems like the next classes that need testing are:

PunctuationAndNumberRemover: You can write tests in the test_punctuation_and_number_remover.py file to ensure that this class correctly removes punctuation and numbers from the text.

StopwordsRemover: You can write tests in the test_stopwords_remover.py file to ensure that this class correctly removes stopwords from the text.

WordcloudGenerator: You can write tests in the test_wordcloud_generator.py file to ensure that this class correctly generates a word cloud from the text.

Remember to follow the TDD process for each of these classes: write a failing test, make it pass, then refactor the code.
